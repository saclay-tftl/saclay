introduction
The game is inspired by works like ET, Super 8, Stranger Things or The Goonies: teenagers with ordinary lives face fantastic events that only they seem to be able to solve.
They live in different 80s. Technology has made fascinating leaps: domestic robots or gravitational trains to go to the office are normal.
You play teenagers whose life is monotonous. Duties, brothers and sisters with whom you constantly fight, parents on your back for nothing ...
Everything is going to change because your city experiences unmistakable events, between inexplicable disappearances, bizarre machines, crazy robots, magic objects, unknowns that declare coming from the past: exciting and dangerous adventures are waiting for you.
Be careful, you can only rely on yourself or your friends: adults do not believe in these things, or prefer not to see them.
